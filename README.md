GlobalFoodAgro is a digital platform designed to streamline the supply of raw food products to the HORECA (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering) industry. This project aims to create an efficient, transparent, and user-friendly marketplace where suppliers can list their products and HORECA businesses can source high-quality ingredients directly.
